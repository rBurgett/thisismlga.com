  "TITLE": "Episode 46 - The Boomer Remover [Adult Language]",
  "NUMBER": 46,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Good news, everyone! Chuck is back and he's here to stay. With my new permanent co-host, we talk about Weinstein's sentencing, pedophilia, the democrats, the cryptkeeper, coronavirus, Chelsea Manning's unfortunate attempted suicide, and the murder of Duncan Lemp at the hands of the police. *Editor's note: There were some sound difficulties that you may notice. My deepest apologies. Also, when I talk about Manning's 35 years, I'm talking about her sentence, not how much time she spent in the pokey. I am a moron and I needed you to know that in advance.*",
