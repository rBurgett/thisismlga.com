  "TITLE": "Episode 50 - Monica Perez, Conspiracy, and the Cathedral [Adult Language]",
  "NUMBER": 50,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Monica Perez from the Propaganda Report and David from the Morning Drive join me this week to get to know Monica, discuss conspiracies, talk about current events, and to break down our feelings on the corporate press and the Cathedral. Join us as we have a lighthearted jaunt through topics ranging from the moon landing, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, Snowden and Assange's possible ties to the CIA, BLM and the George Floyd protests, and whether or not Kurt Cobain killed himself. This is a long conversation that will hopefully be as much fun for you to listen to as it was for me to record.",
