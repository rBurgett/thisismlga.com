  "TITLE": "Episode 115 - Razing Hell (As You Know It) with Chris Date",
  "NUMBER": 115,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, we are joined by Chris Date from Rethinking Hell. If you put \"Conditional Immortality\" into a search engine, you will be treated with pictures of Chris. The concept of Hell is a frightful thing and one that terrifies many. What if we've misread the scriptures? What if the final judgement is different than what we've been told? We will explore this with Chris and we hope you join us.",
