  "TITLE": "Episode 142 - Enemy Love with Cody Cook and John Dangelo",
  "NUMBER": 142,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, I'm a little annoyed. I've seen way too many posts where I've seen Christians allude to hurting, killing, or punishing their enemies. Be it other denominations of Christians, their political foes, or others. \n\nSo, I think it's time to talk about the heart of Christianity, love. \n\nSpecifically, we're going to talk about how Jesus told us to love our enemies. This is countercultural. This makes no sense to most people. But, it is a mandate from our Lord. So, maybe we should heed it.\n\nCody Cook from Cantus Firmus and John Dangelo the Anti-War War Vet join us to talk about enemy love, what it looked like in the early church, what it can look like in our own lives, and who we should be.",
