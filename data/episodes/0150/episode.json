  "TITLE": "Episode 150 - White Devil Jamboree with HEX",
  "NUMBER": 150,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, we are joined by our Twitter pal HEX. You may know him as HEXcellerate. He's a musician, a gun-lover, and a good guy to have in your corner. What you may not have known is that he grew up in the Nation of Islam. When I found out, I had to have him on to talk about it. Join us as we discuss this black nationalist religion, how it is to grow up in it, and how some of us are white devils due to a mad scientist with a big head.",
