  "TITLE": "Episode 153 - Women, Know Your Place with Nick Quient",
  "NUMBER": 153,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, we are joined by a New Testament Theologist who is currently working on his PhD. He's here to give his case for the ordination of women. What's women's place? According to Nick, right beside the men in the church. This isn't a topic that I have settled on, so I want to hear both sides of the debate.",
