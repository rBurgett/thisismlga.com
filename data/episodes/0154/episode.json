  "TITLE": "Episode 154 - Lead Me Up Your Mountaintop with Josh Hiers",
  "NUMBER": 154,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, we are joined by a personal role model of mine, Josh Hiers. When I was in college, he was the premier worship leader. I've met few people on this planet that exude Jesus and his love like Josh does. He was off to be a missionary when he got sick and has been confined to his house since. We're going to catch up and talk about how he's been and how he's dealt with his illness. I can't describe to you how excited I am for this episode.",
