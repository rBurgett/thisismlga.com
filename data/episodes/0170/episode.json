  "TITLE": "Episode 170 - Canceling Calvin with Warren McGrew",
  "NUMBER": 170,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Warren was once a Calvinist. He accepted Calvin's five points (TULIP). But, he walked away from Calvinism. I'd like to find out why.\n\nWhen the majority of online Christianity identifies as reformed in the Calvinist sense, I'd like to hear the other side.\n\nI have, in fact, never been a Calvinist nor have I been able to square what I consider a circle. We may do an episode with a Calvinist in the future to flesh out what they think we missed, but for now, let's take a look at theology, the goodness of God, and what it's like to fight James White.",
